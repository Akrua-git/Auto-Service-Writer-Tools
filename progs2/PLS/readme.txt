You will need to create a fillable .pdf file with the chosen sticker design.

To avoid the need of changing code, the date field should be the first field, with the mileage field second. And the name of the pdf should be "LUBE STICKER.pdf"

I recommend using a PDF viewer app when printing the sticker, it seems to make them print better on my Zebra TLP 2824 Plus. I use PDFx. I use 105% zoom when printing and it fills the sticker fairly well.
